#The Single Responsibility Principle

>	A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

#The Open Closed Principle

>	You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it.

#The Liskov Substitution Principle

>	Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

#The Interface Segregation Principle

>	Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.

#The Dependency Inversion Principle

>	Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
